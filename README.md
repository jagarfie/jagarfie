# **Hi, I'm Jade!**
# *I'm a first-year Graphic Information Technology student at Arizona State University*
I live in the Pacific Northwest, I'm a barista and yes, I love coffee. I'm also a petsitter and have many cat and dog friends who have become family.
I would love to work for Maxis Studios someday, the creators of The Sims™, a game I've played for 20 years now! 
In my freetime, I enjoy photography, riding horses, playing games, watching cooking shows, experimenting with new recipes, watching my favorite Twitch® streamers, exploring in nature, and going to farmer's markets. 
My favorite places in the world are the Pike Place Market in Seattle, WA and the island of Maui, Hawaii. I'd love to move to Hawaii someday.
