# **Hi, I'm Jade!**
# *I'm a first-year Graphic Information Technology student at Arizona State University*
# I live in the Pacific Northwest, I'm a barista and yes, I love coffee. I'm also a petsitter and have many cat and dog friends who have become family.
# I would love to work for Maxis Studios someday, the creators of The Sims™, a game I've played for 20 years now! 
# In my freetime, I enjoy photography, riding horses, playing games, watching cooking shows, experimenting with new recipes, watching my favorite Twitch® streamers, exploring in nature, and going to farmer's markets. 
# My favorite place in the world is the Pike Place Market in Seattle, WA and the island of Maui, Hawaii. I'd love to move to Hawaii someday.
